# HEART-FAILURE-PREDICTION
BY USING MACHINE LEARNING 

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects youâ€™re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.First, we will import the required libraries. Then, we will import the data from heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv file using read_csv() function. The imported data is transferred to dataframe df. A dataframe is a two-dimensional data structure which stores the data in tabular form i.e. rows and columns. And now we will have a look at the data. head() is used to display the first five rows of the dataframe by default.
